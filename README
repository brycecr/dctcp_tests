Instructions to replicate the experiment:

* Login to your AWS account and go to AWS Management Console
and then EC2

* Search for the AMI with the name CS244_DCTCP_WIN13 and
launch the instance with the quicklaunch security setting
and your existing *.pem key, preferably in c1.xlarge mode or
c1.medium (c1.medium should suffice).

* Login to the instance and pull the code from our repository
using the command below :

  git clone
  https://prachetaa@bitbucket.org/prachetaa/cs244_dctcp_win13.git

* We give you the option of reproducing all the figures (including
  the throughput vs N ) or just the figures of the paper. Hence, we
  have two scripts, run_extended that reproduces all the figures
  and run.sh that reproduces figures from the paper only.

 Run the command .sudo ./run_extended.sh. for
replicating all figures. (Takes about 50 minutes to
complete)

  Run the command .sudo ./run.sh. for replicating all figures
except for throughput vs N graph. (Takes about 30 minutes to
complete)

* Do not close the terminal running the experiments as they
stop if you close them. The experiments will complete and
the graphs will be mailed to you and we will stop the
instance once this is done.

* NOTE : The shell scripts ask you for your email id, please
provide them without any spaces and in the format
xyz@zyx.com . This is for emailing the graphs back to you
without the pain to copy them to your local machine etc.
Furthermore, the script asks you whether you want to
shutdown the instance automatically once the graphs are
reproduced. Please provide a Boolean answer of 1 or 0 and we
will shutdown the instance automatically once done. However,
please note that any issues in between can lead to issues
where we will not be able to send out the results via mail
and cannot shut down the instance, so please do verify that
the instance is shut down.
